Understand how we can use CSS concepts to achieve multiple layouts for our webpages\n2. Specifically, learn how to use floats to achieve multi-column grids\n3. Additionally, explore how we can use flexbox to ahieve the same multi-column grids, but with fewer headaches\n\n#### Rundown\n---\n\n#### [Warmup](#warmup)\n#### [Floats](#floats)\n#### [FlexBox](#flexbox)\n#### [Practical CSS3 Use Cases](#practical-css3-use-cases)\n#### [Multiple Screens](#multiple-screens)\n#### [Frontend Frameworks](#frontend-frameworks)\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Achieving Layouts with CSS","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"An introduction to floats and flexbox as a means for building various webpage layouts","idx":2},"warmup":{"content":"# Warmup\n---\n\nLet's begin by recapping what we covered last week.\n\n#### Wendy Bite\n---\n\nLet's go ahead and complete the Wendy Bite Assignment from last week.\n\n#### [Code From Last Class](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/FEWD629_WendyBiteLecture4_Notes)\n\nOur goal is to complete this assignment using best class naming and resuing practices.\n\n#### Box Model Review\n---\n\n![Image](http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif)\n\nLet's talk through this. \n\nWhat is the **border**?

Floats are a concept (though kind of convoluted) which help us build complex layouts and grids with more ease.\n\n## [Technical Example](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Floats_Ex) | [Live Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Floats_Ex)\n\n#### Exercises\n---\nWe will solve these problems after our discussion period.\n\n#### [Simple Layouts with floats](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Simple_Layouts_with_floats) | [Live Instructor Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Simple_Layouts_with_floats)\n\n#### [Addding Float](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Addding_Float) | [Live Instructor Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Addding_Float)\n\n#### [Simple Clears](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Simple_Clears) | [Live Instructor Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Simple_Clears)\n#### [Using Clearfix](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Using_Clearfix) | [Live Instructor Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/FEWD_Using_Clearfix)\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n#### Examples\n---\nWe will use these examples to understand the concept at hand.\n\n#### [Simple Three Column Layout](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4258)\n#### [Clearfixing the Parent](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4702)\n#### [Practical Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4927)\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n#### Important Facts\n---\n\n1. How do they work??\n2. A left-floated box will shift to the left until its leftmost margin edge (or border edge if margins are absent) touches either the edge of the containing block, or the edge of another floated box\n3. If the size of the floated box exceeds the available horizontal space, the floated box will be shifted down\n4. Non-positioned, non-floated, block-level elements act as if the floated element is not there, since the floated element is out of flow in relation to other block elements\n5. The root element (<html>) cannot be floated\n5. An inline element that is floated is converted to a block-level element\n\n\n#### Clears\n---\n\n1. This is the anti-float\n2. clearing an item (can be a floated or non floated item) will undo the effects of the float\n3. if we're smart about how we arrange our tag structures, we don't really need to rely on this too much\n\n#### The Collapsing Parent\n---\n\n1. float the parent (meh)\n2. empty div in markup with clear: both (meh)\n3. overflow: hidden or auto (better)\n4. clearfix (best)\n\n","idx":4},"flexbox":{"content":"# FlexBox\n---\n\nFlexbox is the newest standard which aims to help make it easier to build modern web interfaces with CSS.

Desktop First\n---\nThese two schemas are techniques for how we structure our css.\n\n**Most important takeaway**: almost always go with mobile first.\n\n \n* Remember, CSS is cascading which means that we can write one set of styles and then reapply other styles on top of that.\n\n#### Mobile First\n\nWith mobile first, we create the mobile layout first, then add a media query for tablet (with tablet styles) and then add a media query for desktop (with desktop styles)\n\n#### Desktop First\n\nWith desktop first, we create the desktop layout first (so styles for desktop), then add a media query for tablet, then mobile.\n\n#### Mobile First > Desktop First\n**Here's why**:\nforces you to think about the stuff that's really necessary for simplest version of your page and implement those\n\n\n* With mobile first, you simply add styles as needed as width increases (vs removing styles the other way around, which leads to writing more code)\n\n#### Examples\n---\nHere are some examples of different media queries.\n\n* #### [Basic Example; Mobile first](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4080)\n\n* #### [Basic; Desktop first](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4081)\n\n* #### [AND-ing](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4082)\n\n* #### [OR-ing](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4083)\n\n* #### [Buckets](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4084)\n\n* #### [Overriding](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4085)\n\n#### Common Breakpoints\n---\n**NOTE**: you should **NEVER** design for device specificity.
